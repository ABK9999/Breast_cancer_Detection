# Breast_cancer_Detection
This breast cancer detection model was built using a combination of Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms. To improve its accuracy, hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV. The model was trained on a dataset of 600 breast cancer patients, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.24%.
